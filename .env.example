# Copy to .env and update when using docker-compose or running locally
# Example: use MySQL (replace placeholders with your real credentials)
# DATABASE_URL=mysql://db_user:db_password@db_host:3306/messageboard
# If you prefer SQLite for local testing, uncomment the sqlite line below.
DATABASE_URL=mysql://Wang:A19356756837@52.196.78.16:3306/messageboard

# Notes:
# - This example shows a MySQL URL to match the hardcoded value in main.py.
# - The project requirements already include `python-multipart` (for form handling)
#   and `aiomysql` (async MySQL driver). Make sure those are installed in your image.
